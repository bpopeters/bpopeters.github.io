I am a postdoctoral NLP researcher at Instituto de Telecomunicações in Lisbon.
These days I primarily reseach the use of LLMs for translation (of both text and speech), but I've worked on a variety of other problems throughout the years, often at the intersection of neural NLP with morphology and phonology.
I also maintain the [entmax](https://github.com/deep-spin/entmax) package, which provides fast PyTorch implementations of a family of differentiable sparse alternatives to softmax.
